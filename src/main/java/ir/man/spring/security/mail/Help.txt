The interfaces and classes for Java mail support in the Spring framework are organized as follows:
MailSender interface: the top-level interface that provides basic functionality for sending simple emails
JavaMailSender interface: the subinterface of the above MailSender. It supports MIME messages and is mostly used in conjunction with the MimeMessageHelper class for the creation of a MimeMessage. It's recommended to use the MimeMessagePreparator mechanism with this interface.
JavaMailSenderImpl class provides an implementation of the JavaMailSender interface. It supports the MimeMessage and SimpleMailMessage.
SimpleMailMessage class: used to create a simple mail message including the from, to, cc, subject and text fields
MimeMessagePreparator interface provides a callback interface for the preparation of MIME messages.
MimeMessageHelper class: helper class for the creation of MIME messages. It offers support for images, typical mail attachments and text content in an HTML layout.
